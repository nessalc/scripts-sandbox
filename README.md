# scripts-sandbox

This is a collection of random scripts or code ideas that don't necessarily fit anywhere else, but I want to share them.

- [pdf-toolkit/pdf-toolkit.py](pdf-toolkit/pdf-toolkit.py): written with Python 3, Tkinter, and using [pikepdf](//github.com/pikepdf/pikepdf), this gives an interface to do some handy-dandy things with PDF files that I need to do often, but can't without Adobe Pro. Thankfully, there are other ways, and I made it a bit easier with a GUI.
- [numbers/](numbers/): this folder (will eventually) contain math-related scripts. Collatz conjecture, Recam√°n circles, primality testing, fractal generators of various types, etc.
- [sandbox/](sandbox/): (eventually) things I couldn't fit anywhere else. Color utilities, bit manipulation routines, personal implementations of soundex, punycode, compression algorithms, encryption algorithms...whatever.
